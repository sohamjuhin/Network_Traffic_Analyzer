Network_Traffic_Analyzer

# To run this script on Kali Linux, you need to have the scapy library installed. You can install it using the following command:


pip install scapy



# Save the script to a file, such as network_traffic_analyzer.py, and then run the script using the following command:



sudo python3 network_traffic_analyzer.py



The script uses the sniff() function from scapy to capture and analyze network traffic. In the analyze_traffic() function, you can access different fields of the captured packets, such as source IP, destination IP, and protocol, to perform analysis or extract information as needed.

Please note that network traffic analysis can involve complex techniques and is often performed using specialized tools. This is a basic example, and for more comprehensive analysis, it is recommended to use professional network analysis tools that provide more advanced features and capabilities.

Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that you have proper authorization and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when capturing and analyzing network traffic.
